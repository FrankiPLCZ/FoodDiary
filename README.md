# FoodDiary
It is a diet application for android written in Kotlin. It helps in keeping track of how much protein and kcal you eat. 
When you open app, first you need to fill in needed data.

When you submit the data you are taken to main screen when you can track what you have eaten so far and your needed kcal and protein intake are calculated and set on progressbar.
